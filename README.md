# Using in Android Studio
All of the projects should have a build.gradle file suitable for importing the project into Android Studio. Note, though, that you may need to adjust the compileSdkVersion in build.gradle if it requests an SDK that you have not downloaded and do not wish to download. Similarly, you may need to adjust the buildToolsVersion value to refer to a version of the build tools that you have downloaded from the SDK Manager.
